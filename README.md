When it comes down to understanding what users need, I’ve found that clear communication and breaking down goals into “stories,” are game changers. User stories help translate vague requirements into specific tasks that we can work on. By framing stories from a user perspective, I can keep the project focused on delivering value. I can stay in tuned with what users want and not just what I think might be useful. It also helps me prioritize the work so each feature added can enhance the user experience and align with our goals. 

My approach to program development is rooted in Agile, especially Scrum. Agile’s focus on iterations and adaptability is a natural fit for real world projects. In the future I want to keep using regular Sprint Reviews to help me stay aligned with user’s needs. Also, I will keep using Retrospectives to help improve both my work and the team’s progress. This will not only help me keep development flexible, but it will help maintain a rhythm that keeps everyone focused. 

Being a good team member is being able to balance my technical contributions with effective collaborations. There is so much value in listening to other team members ideas and offering constructive feedback. A good team member is dependable and constantly communicating with their team. Software development depends on teamwork and the best results come from a team where people are supporting each other and have shared goals.
